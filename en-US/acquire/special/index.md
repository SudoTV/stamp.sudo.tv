Some of the stamps are available through special events. Compared to other methods, special event are very rare. During the time period when there are special events, [SudoTV Main](https://sudo.tv) will display verbose information.

Under every stamp detail page, there's a method of acquiring section in it, which looks like this:

<blockquote>
{% assign methods=page.localization %}

{% include stamp/method-text.html
    methods=site.data.stamp.ghost.methods
%}
</blockquote>

If special event is one of the methods of acquiring, you can continue to follow the [SudoTV Main](https://sudo.tv) activities. If you have any question regards stamps, send an email to [stamp@sudo.tv](mailto://stamp@sudo.tv) to contact us.
